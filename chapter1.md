# Chapter 1  

* Deep learning is a technique that extract and transform data using multiple layers of neural networks. 
* Neural Networks are models. 
* There are many types of models. Neural network is one type of models.
* Human brain is a network of nodes, these nodes are binary logic processor. Activity of the nodes can be expressed with propositional logic. This concept of brain led to the design of Artificial Neural Network design. 
* Back propagation in Neural network is analogous to synaptic plasticity. While synaptic plasticity helps us to learn and adjust for new knowledge, Neural network learns by back-propagating to adjust its connection weights.
